C This is variation in the MatMult subroutine Do loops. Loop variable i ranges
C from current thread number to maximum number of rows in A in steps of
C maximum number of threads. Loop variable j ranges across all columns of B,
C but is staggered according to current thread number to minimize memory
C contention on an SMP machine. Loop variable jj translates (maps) value of j
C to fall within permissible range of B, that is from 1 to B_Columns

      Do i = CurrentThread, A_Rows,  MaxThreadCount
         Do j = (CurrentThread-1)*MaxThreadCount,
     +           B_Columns + (CurrentThread-1)*MaxThreadCount - 1
            jj =  1 + mod(j, B_Columns)
            Do k = 1, A_Columns
               C(i, jj)  =  C(i, jj) + A(i, k) * B(k, jj)
            End Do
         End Do
      End Do
