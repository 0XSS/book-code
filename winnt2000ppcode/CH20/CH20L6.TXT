      program ChildProcess

      character*255 buffer
      character*100 filename, strReadEvent, strWriteEvent
      integer*4 hReadEvent, hWriteEvent, OpenEvent, SetEvent
      integer*2 status
      integer*4 EVENT_ALL_ACCESS
      integer*4 waitResult, WaitForSingleObject

Retrieving the first command line parameter which is the name of the ReadEvent
      Call Getarg (1, buffer, status)
      strReadEvent(1:status) = buffer(1:status)
      status = status+1
      strReadEvent(status:status) = char(0) ! to make it a C string

Retrieving the second command line parameter which is the name of the WriteEvent
      Call Getarg (2, buffer, status)
      strWriteEvent(1:status) = buffer(1:status)
      status = status+1
      strWriteEvent(status:status) = char(0) ! to make it a C string

Setting the access privilege for the child
      EVENT_ALL_ACCESS = IOR (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED, SYNCHRONIZE)
      EVENT_ALL_ACCESS = IOR (EVENT_ALL_ACCESS, #3)

Opening handles for event objects passed from parent as named objects
      hReadEvent=OpenEvent(EVENT_ALL_ACCESS, .FALSE.,  loc(strReadEvent))
      hWriteEvent=OpenEvent(EVENT_ALL_ACCESS, .FALSE., loc(strWriteEvent))

Wait until the parent signals the WriteEvent
      waitResult = WaitForSingleObject(hWriteEvent, WAIT_INFINITE)

Retrieve the file name which is the third argument
      Call Getarg (3, buffer, status)
      filename (1:status) = buffer(1:status)

Read the parent's question and then reply
      open (11, file= filename, mode ='readwrite')
      read(11, '(A)') buffer
      print *, buffer
      rewind 11
      write(11, '(A)') 'September 1993 issue'
      close (11)

Signal the parent to continue
      waitResult = SetEvent(hReadEvent)
      end
